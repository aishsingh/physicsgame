Physics Game
============

A poorly named game that will soon become a fully functional android app.  
The physics environment was originally derived from one of my comp science assignment.  

###Concept
_\<Ideas will be placed here soon>_

###Development
The android app is running **native c++** code using JNI with the _android-ndk_.  
**OpenGL ES 2** is used for surface rendering.
